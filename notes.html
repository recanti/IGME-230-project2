                For this assignment, I focused on building a workflow utilizing Grunt and Sass. Sass was used mainly for creating a component-based file structure for styling, as well as for a few conveniences like variables. I used Grunt to create a compile folder. This contained a copy of the script and HTML files, as well as compiled sass code. I also used it to automatically resize images to a common width. A link to the project can be found on my github.

                I used Colourlovers to create my palette for the site. You can find it here. I wanted to stick to a mostly black-and-white aesthetic with a little bit of color used for emphasis. 
            </p>

                Although I'm grateful for the organization that Sass has afforded me, I still feel like some of the blocks got a bit out-of-hand. I tended to add components when needed, and ended up breaking my plan a bit. When I go back to this, I would probably try to spruce up the files a bit and organize my components better.

                I also had a bit of difficulty getting images for the site. It was easy to capture a screenshot of the piece, but finding the best portion to show off in a 300x300 pixel button, was a bit daunting. I think most of them came out okay, but it's something I definitely want to try looking into int the future.
